the initial React project by using the create-react-app script. What’s great about create-react-app is that this script can be executed by using the npx command without the need to install it first on your system. Just execute the following command:
npx create-react-app mern-todo-app

Executing this command creates a new project directory mern-todo-app. Inside this folder you’ll find the default React project template with all dependencies installed. Change into the newly created folder:
cd mern-todo-app
and start the development web server by running the following command:
npm start
